			<h2>What is a Blockchain?</h2>

			<p>Blockchains are permissionless distributed databases or permissionless public records of transactions in chronological order. </p>
			<p>Blockchain technology creates a decentralized digital public record of transactions that is secure, 
			anonymous, tamper-proof and unchangeable - a shared single source of truth.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Currency (electronic cash systems without intermediaries)</li>
				<li>Payment infrastructure (remittance; sending money in payment)</li>
				<li>Digital assets (exchange of information)</li>
				<li>Digital identity (IDs for digitally signing to reduce fraud)</li>
				<li>Verifiable data (verify the authenticity of information or processes)</li>
				<li>Smart contracts (software programs that execute without trusted third parties)</li>

			<h2>How does it work?</h2>

			<p>The bitcoin blockchain is “decentralized,” meaning it is not controlled by one central authority.</p>
			<p>While traditional currencies are issued by central banks, bitcoin has no central authority. Instead, the bitcoin blockchain is maintained by a network of people known as miners.</p>
			<p>These “miners,” sometimes called “nodes” on the network, are people running purpose-built computers that are actually competing to solve complex mathematical problems in order to make a transaction go through.</p>
			<p>For example, say lots of people are making bitcoin transactions. Each transaction originates from a wallet which has a “private key.” This is a digital signature and provides mathematical proof that the transaction has come from the owner of the wallet.</p>
			<p>Now imagine lots of transactions are taking place across the world. These individual transactions are grouped together into a block, organized by strict cryptographic rules. The block is sent out to the bitcoin network, which are made up of people running high-powered computers. These computers compete to validate the transactions by trying to solve complex mathematical puzzles.</p>
			<p>The winner receives an award in bitcoin.</p>
			<p>This validated block is then added onto previous blocks creating a chain of blocks called a blockchain. </p>
